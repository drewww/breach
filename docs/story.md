BREACH

GAMEPLAY VIGNETTES
------------------

The smoke dissipates, and the Titan is still standing. That mine wasn't enough, and you don't have any left. Your muscles tense, and you release a surge of energy into the exoskeleton and *towards* the Titan, hoping a close-range shotgun blast will be enough to shut it down before its magnetically acuated fist crushes you.

You spy a cluster of Locusts between you and the closet of prototypes your handler tagged on your map. You pause, hoping they'll head they'll head away. Bad luck; the patrol AI sends them right at you. Your pistol is no use against so many simultaneous targets. You toss a smoke grenade and hope you can find a less dangerous path to the vault.

JOURNAL
-------

2.12.85 --- A breach so straightforward, they loaded me into a second one the moment I jacked out. (+100$)
2.15.85 --- Lost a day of work to what the medics are calling "disordered disconnection." Code for "your frame was so rapidly destroyed your body thinks it died." (-300$)
2.16.85 --- Successful extraction with a full load. (+500$)
2.17.85 --- No frames available today, maintenace is backed up. 
2.18.85 --- Shotgun misfired next to a [bruiser]. Never should have been sent out with such unreliable equipment. Left a pristine data-vault behind. Stupid.
2.19.85 --- I can't remember the last time I saw the sun. (+50$)


MYRM -- Melee swarm ant

Originally designed to lift other workers, their scissor lifts have been adapted to be remarkably strong melee weapons. 

"...a cluster of Myrms making music with their motors last night. What's up with that?"

"The last three times I requested a Myrm it had the same pattern of scratches carved into its rear hull."
